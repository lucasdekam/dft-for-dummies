| **Team 1** |     How does the activity of different heterogeneous catalysts depend on the precise acid concentration in an acidic regime? |
| **Team 2** |     How does the activity of the heterogeneous catalysts depend on the presence of cations under alkaline conditions? |
| **Team 3** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the   amount of catalytic material? |
| **Team 4** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the   metal site?|
| **Team 5** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the pH?|
| **Team 6** |     How does the activity of the different heterogeneous catalysts   depend on the precise base concentration under alkaline conditions? |
| **Team 7** |     How does the activity of the different heterogeneous catalysts   depend on the buffer constitution under relative neutral conditions?  |
