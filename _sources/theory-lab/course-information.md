```{admonition} Learning goals 
:class: tip
In the report you should show that you are able to...

* calculate the binding energy of an adsorbate
* choose a small research project, motivate your choice, and describe the expected outcome
* describe the most important parameters for a DFT calculation (for inspiration: {cite:p}`norskov2004origin`)
* answer your research question, and analyze your results with a critical view
* compare your methods and results to scientific publications (some publications can be found in the reference lists on the pages of the respective projects)

## Interesting talks in the LO1 period

If there's time we might attend the following talks.

| Date    | Time  | Location | Speaker |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| June 11 | 16:00 | Atrium   | Marc Koper (Tuesday Talk) |
| June 12 | 11:00 | GM4.13   | Kieron Burke (LIC talk) |
| June 17 | 9:00  | EM1.21   | Electrochemistry group meeting |

Prof. Marc Koper researches electrocatalysis here at LIC. He will talk about making hydrogen using water electrolysis driven by renewable energy. 

Prof. Kieron Burke is one of the people who developed the well-known PBE exchange-correlation functional. He will explain the current state of the art of DFT in general language, and talk about his recent research. 

In the electrochemistry group meeting, post-docs and PhD's will talk about their current research. Topics include: DFT simulations of platinum electrodes, electrochemical characterization of gold electrodes, spectroscopy of water and ions near electrodes.
